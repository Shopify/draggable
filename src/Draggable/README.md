## Draggable

### Usage

- NPM:

```js
import {Draggable} from '@shopify/draggable';
// Or
import Draggable from '@shopify/draggable/build/esm/Draggable/Draggable';

const draggable = new Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
  draggable: 'li',
});
```

- Browser (as a module):

```html
<script type="module">
  import Draggable from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shopify/draggable/build/esm/Draggable/Draggable.mjs';

  const draggable = new Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
    draggable: 'li',
  });
</script>
```

- Browser (Standalone):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@shopify/draggable/build/umd/index.min.js"></script>
<script>
  const draggable = new Draggable.Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
    draggable: 'li',
  });
</script>
```

### API

**`new Draggable(containers: HTMLElement[]|NodeList|HTMLElement, options: Object): Draggable`**  
To create a draggable instance you need to specify the container(s) that hold draggable items, e.g.
`document.body` would work too. The second argument is an options object, which is described
below.

**`draggable.destroy(): void`**  
Detaches all sensors and listeners, and cleans up after itself.

**`draggable.on(eventName: String, listener: Function): Draggable`**  
Draggable is an event emitter, so you can register callbacks for events. Draggable
also supports method chaining.

**`draggable.off(eventName: String, listener: Function): Draggable`**  
You can unregister listeners by using `.off()`, make sure to provide the same callback.

**`draggable.trigger(event: AbstractEvent): void`**  
You can trigger events through draggable. This is used to fire events internally or by
extensions of Draggable.

**`draggable.addPlugin(plugins: ...typeof Plugin): Draggable`**  
Adds plugins to this draggable instance.

**`draggable.removePlugin(plugins: ...typeof Plugin): Draggable`**  
Removes plugins that are already attached to this draggable instance.

**`draggable.addSensor(sensors: ...typeof Sensor): Draggable`**  
Adds sensors to this draggable instance.

**`draggable.removeSensor(sensors: ...typeof Sensor): Draggable`**  
Removes sensors that are already attached to this draggable instance.

**`draggable.addContainer(containers: ...HTMLElement): Draggable`**  
Adds containers to this draggable instance.

**`draggable.removeContainer(containers: ...HTMLElement): Draggable`**  
Removes containers from this draggable instance.

**`draggable.getClassNameFor(name: String): String`**  
Returns class name for class identifier, check the classes table below for identifiers.

**`draggable.getClassNamesFor(name: String): String[]`**  
Returns array of class name for class identifier, useful when working with atomic css, check the classes table below for identifiers.

**`draggable.isDragging(): Boolean`**  
Returns true or false, depending on this draggables dragging state.

**`draggable.getDraggableElementsForContainer(container: HTMLElement): HTMLElement[]`**  
Returns draggable elements for given container, excluding potential mirror or original source.

**`draggable.cancel(): void`**  
Cancel current dragging state immediately
_NOTE_: Can't revert elements that were changed to the beginning state (e.g sorted elements)

### Options

**`draggable {String}`**  
A css selector for draggable elements within the `containers` specified. By default it will
look for an element with `.draggable-source` class. Default: `.draggable-source`

**`handle {String}`**  
Specify a css selector for a handle element if you don't want to allow drag action
on the entire element. Default: `null`

**`delay {Number|Object}`**  
If you want to delay a drag start you can specify delay in milliseconds. This can be useful
for draggable elements within scrollable containers. To allow touch scrolling, we set 100ms delay for TouchSensor by default. Default:

```js
{
  mouse: 0,
  drag: 0,
  touch: 100,
}
```

You can set the same delay for all sensors by setting a number, or set an object to set the delay for each sensor separately.

**`distance {Number}`**  
The distance you want the pointer to have moved before drag starts. This can be useful
for clickable draggable elements, such as links. Default: `0`

**`plugins {Plugin[]}`**  
Plugins add behaviour to Draggable by hooking into its life cycle, e.g. one of the default
plugins controls the mirror movement. Default: `[]`

**`sensors {Sensor[]}`**  
Sensors dictate how drag operations get triggered, by listening to native browser events.
By default draggable includes the `MouseSensor` & `TouchSensor`. Default: `[]`

**`classes {{String: String|String[]}}`**  
Draggable adds classes to elements to indicate state. These classes can be used to add styling
on elements in certain states. Accept String or Array of strings.

**NOTE**: When specifying multiple classes to an indicate state, the first class MUST be unique for that state to avoid duplicate classes for other states. IE doesn't support add or remove multiple classes. If you want to use multiple classes in IE, you need to add a classList polyfill to your project first.

**`exclude {plugins: Plugin[], sensors: Sensor[]}`**  
Allow excluding default plugins and default sensors. Use with caution as it may create strange behavior.

### Examples

This sample code will make list items draggable:

```js
import {Draggable} from '@shopify/draggable';

const draggable = new Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
  draggable: 'li',
});

draggable.on('drag:start', () => console.log('drag:start'));
draggable.on('drag:move', () => console.log('drag:move'));
draggable.on('drag:stop', () => console.log('drag:stop'));
```

Create draggable which excluded some default plugins and sensor:

```js
import {Draggable} from '@shopify/draggable';

const draggable = new Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
  draggable: 'li',
  exclude: {
    plugins: [Draggable.Plugins.Focusable],
    sensors: [Draggable.Sensors.TouchSensor],
  },
});
```

Create draggable with specific classes:

```js
import {Draggable} from '@shopify/draggable';

const draggable = new Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
  draggable: 'li',
  classes: {
    'draggable:over': ['draggable--over', 'bg-red-200', 'bg-opacity-25'],
  },
});
```

Cancel dragging on ESC key up:

```js
import {Draggable} from '@shopify/draggable';

const draggable = new Draggable(document.querySelectorAll('ul'), {
  draggable: 'li',
  classes: {
    'draggable:over': ['draggable--over', 'bg-red-200', 'bg-opacity-25'],
  },
});
```
